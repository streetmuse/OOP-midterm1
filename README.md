# OOP-midterm1
In this midterm I strugled with a lot of things including incorrect sintaxes, package creation adn etc. with the help of uploaded materials and AI I was able to complete the tasks and eradicate errors. AI was very useful, there was no task that I had given to it without satisfactory response, if there was any problems it was because of me using AI incorrectly. It made tasks where i had to write one thing many times a lot easier and faster, it also helped me with understanding some tasks. The main part where AI was used is the last task, It suggested me to add some new features, which i did and also made the entire projec more appealing or at least better then i had done it. There was no case of me getting undesireble result.
